# smile/Smiley

Smiley was created on Saturday night, just for fun. Done at the beginning of the BIT boot camp and with very basic knowledge set. 
Starting idea was the utilization of Pythagorean theorem. At first, eye centers were at 1/4-1/4 and 3/4-1/4, but Smiley was then a bit squint-eyed, so additional calibration had to occur. Function parameters are setting the size of the Smiley face and width of the line. 
 
 
Code is intentionally not refactored and the original can be found at my "bit-pp" repositorium.
